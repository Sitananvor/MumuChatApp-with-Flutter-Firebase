# MumuChatApp with Flutter and Firebase

This is a basic application and web browser project to practice and get an introduction to how to use Flutter and Firebase. It helps new developers like myself practice Flutter and Firebase development.
I am following the **Backslash Flutter** channel on YouTube for guidance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwk5oIAkgnY&list=LL&index=70) and adapting some features to be more user-friendly, including a feature that allows users to upload a profile picture, which can be selected from the camera or gallery and removed if needed. The Firebase plan Iâ€™m using is the free plan.
